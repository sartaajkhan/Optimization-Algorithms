delOptimum consists of numerous numerical methods and algorithms which are used for the optimization of objective functions. It consists of
both univariate and multivariate functions. The main objective is to expose the user to the numerous algorithms that are available, rather than
developing algebraic equations to compute the approximate optimal coordinates of a univariate/multivariate function. Another objective that I want to 
meet is for the user to input in any function (with their initial guess on the optimal coordinates), and the algorithm decides which numerical method
to utilize to minimize computational time.

This repository is divided into two parts: single variable and multivariable algorithms. This is still currently in development.
