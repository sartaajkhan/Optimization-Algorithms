This file will consist of numerical optimization methods and algorithms when working with multivariable functions:
F = F(X1,X2,...,XN)

MATH OPERATORS THESE FILES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH:
math_ops = {'sqrt':sqrt,'log':log,'sin':sin,'cos':cos,'tan':tan,
                'asin':asin, 'acos':acos, 'atan':atan, 'asinh':asinh, 'acosh':acosh,
                'atanh':atanh, 'pow':pow, 'exp':exp,
                'fabs':fabs, 'factorial': factorial, 'floor': floor}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Partial derivative computations
2. Gradient computation
3. Jacobian matrix computation
4. Hessian matrix computation

There are two forms of optimization of interest: constrained and unconstrained.
UNCONSTRAINED ALGORITHMS:
1. GRADIENT DESCENT
2. GRADIENT ASCENT
3. NEWTON'S METHOD

CONSTRAINED ALGORITHMS CONTENT:
1. GRADIENT ASCENT/DESCENT WITH CONSTANT BOUNDS: {X1≤X≤X2, Y1≤Y≤Y2, ....}

Algorithms are still in development. Updated: Tuesday May 4th, 2021
