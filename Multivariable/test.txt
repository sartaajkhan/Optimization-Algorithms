This file will consist of numerical optimization methods and algorithms when working with multivariable functions:
F = F(X1,X2,...,XN)

There are two forms of optimization of interest: constrained and unconstrained.
Unconstrained numerical methods available in this repository only involve the gradient ascent and descent algorithms. More to come.
Constrained numerical methods are also currently in development.
